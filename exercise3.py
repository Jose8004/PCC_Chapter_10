10-6. Addition: One common problem when prompting for numerical input occurs
 when people provide text instead of numbers. When you try to convert the 
 input to an int, youâ€™ll get a ValueError. 
 Write a program that prompts for two numbers. Add them together and print the result.
 Catch the ValueError if either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error 
message. 
Test your program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text instead of a number.
